# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Different approaches to implement an AI to play the game

I chose the game of Tic-Tac-Toe because the game is simple and a position doesn't have a lot of possible game variants, unlike games like chess where the number of different positions becomes extremely high very quickly. 

I implemented different approaches to code the opponent:
- Minimax
- Alpha-Beta pruning
- Monte-Carlo Tree Search

</br>
I also added a GUI using pygame. The player can play with either the Xs or the Os, and the AI will take the others automatically. </br>
